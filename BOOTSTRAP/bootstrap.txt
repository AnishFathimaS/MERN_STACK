* Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter in 2010.

* What is Bootstrap?
    Bootstrap is a free, open-source front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides pre-built, customizable components like grids, buttons, forms, and navigation.

* Grid System 
    Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid system to design layouts that automatically adjust for different screen sizes, making it easy to create responsive web pages.

* Pre-styled Components
    It includes pre-designed components like navigation bars, modals, cards, buttons, and alerts, so you donâ€™t need to write custom styles from scratch.

* Responsive Design
    Bootstrap is designed to be mobile-first and includes CSS media queries to make websites adapt to different screen sizes such as smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
